            geo (the "container"); does not have to nest cleanly

            by area, do not supply values for geo_cell or wt
            
    The moment of inertia of a shape changes as the shape is translated in
    coordinate space. The moment of inertia about the centroid is the 
    minimum moment of inertia for a given shape. The MI of a circle of the
    same area as the shape is divided by the MI of the shape to convert to a 
    "shape index".
    
    When geo_cell is missing, the value calculated is knowsn as the "area 
    moment of inertia" or "second moment of area". It is calculated from the
    polygon coordinates. As with other compactness measures, the final value 
    varies from 0 (least compact) to 1 (most compact, a circle).
    
    When geo_cell is supplied, the value calculated is the "mass moment of
    inertia" or, simply, the "moment of inertia". In this case each cell
    is weighted by some value, specified by the parameter wt. For demographic
    data, the "mass" will usually be the cell population. if the mass is the 
    cell area, this is equivalent to the second moment of inertia, and geo_cell
    should just be omitted. Importanly, in calculating the shape index, the 
    reference circle has the same area of the shape *and uniform density*.
    Therefore, unlike most other compactness measures, this shape index is *not* 
    constrained to be between 0 and 1. If the shape has mass (population)
    concentrated near the center of the shape, the shape can be more compact
    than the reference circle, and the return value will be greater than 1.
